Game Character Manager (Flutter + Firebase)
This mobile app lets users create and manage game characters with custom stats, skills, and slogans. The app includes:

Data Persistence:  Data is stored/retrieved in real time using Firebase.

Character Management: Add characters, view them later, mark favorites, and update stats such as health, tactics, and skills.

Interactive UI: Integrated animations (Hero transitions, animation controllers) for smooth navigation across three main screens.

State Management: Implemented Provider for clean data handling across multiple screens.


This project demonstrates experience with Flutter development, Firebase integration, state management, and UI/UX animations.
